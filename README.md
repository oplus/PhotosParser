# PhotosParser
A photo parser for condo apartments brookers page 

Steps to use the script:

1. Go to the MLS page and copy all the content (Ctrl + A) => (Ctrl + C)
2. Paste all the page contents to MLS.txt
3. Run the script

You should see find created directoriy for each MLS in the page titled by the MLS number and containing the MLS photos.

Note: I couldn't optimize the script speed to be faster (For one page containing 11 MLS the script need around 15 minutes).
